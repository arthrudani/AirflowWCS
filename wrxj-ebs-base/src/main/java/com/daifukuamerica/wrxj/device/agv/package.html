<B>AGV Interface</B>
<P>This package facilitates message processing from the SAM system.  The main class of interest
   in this package is the {@link com.daifukuamerica.wrxj.device.agv.AGVController AGVController}. This
   class handles all of the message traffic between SAM and WarehouseRx, and calls the appropriate parser
   and formatter.</P><P>An attempt has been made to write this package in a portable manner.  The main item
   in this package that is not portable is the AGVController.  This is written strictly as a Wrx JMS
   controller (thread).  All of the logic for message handling here will need to be ported to the
   architecture of the target system.  In addition, the following interfaces will need to be implemented:
   {@link com.daifukuamerica.wrxj.device.agv.AGVLogger AGVLogger},
   {@link com.daifukuamerica.wrxj.device.agv.CMSStatusNotifier CMSStatusNotifier}, and
   {@link com.daifukuamerica.wrxj.device.agv.AGVDBInterface AGVDBInterface} interfaces.</P><P>The AGVLogger interface
   is used for logging messages.  WarehouseRx uses custom logging and so this interface is necessary for portability.</P>
   <P>The CMSStatusNotifier interface is to be used for accessing the system's message service.  For WarehouseRx this is of course JBoss.
   If there is no message service provider on the target system, a stub implementation will be required.</P><P>The AGVDBInterface
   interface is necessary to tie into any custom api that may have been written for database operations.  This package also uses its
   own tables as much as possible for portability.</P>
