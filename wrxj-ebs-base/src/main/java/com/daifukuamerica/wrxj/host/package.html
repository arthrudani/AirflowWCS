Host Interface
<P>This package is for supporting an interface to various types of host systems.  A
   Host is any entity that is passing information to the WarehouseRx system.  The
   Java interfaces in this package allow for multiple communication protocols, and
   data access to various types of Host related tables.  </P><P>The main classes of interest
   in this package are the {@link com.daifukuamerica.wrxj.host.HostController HostController} and
   {@link com.daifukuamerica.wrxj.host.HostMessageIntegrator HostMessageIntegrator}. The {@link com.daifukuamerica.wrxj.host.HostController HostController} class directs
   inbound or outbound traffic to the appropriate handling programs.  The {@link com.daifukuamerica.wrxj.host.HostMessageIntegrator HostMessageIntegrator} class integrates messages from the host into the WarehouseRx system.</P>
