Application configuration.

<p><b>Details:</b> Package <code>com.daifukuamerica.wrxj.common.io</code> supports
application configuration and startup.  The most important interfaces in this
package is <code>ControllerListConfiguration</code>,
<code>ControllerDefinition</code>, and <code>ControllerTypeDefinition</code>.
These three interfaces encapsulates all of the controller configuration
information for a given application instance.  Most of the other classes in this
package are built around this interface.</p>

<p>Classes beginning with the prefix "<code>Freeform</code>..." support the
"freestyle" controller configuration format, the loosely-<wbr>defined text
format that was originally used by <code>ControllerImplFactory</code>.  These
classes are now deprecated and will soon be removed from the project.</p>

<p><code>PropertyReader</code> and <code>PropertyFileReader</code> are the
utility classes used to parse files in this freeform format.  Although they are
no longer used for controller list configuration files, they are still employed
elsewhere in the project and must be preserved until the modules that use them
can be refactored.</p>

<p>Classes beginning with the prefix "<code>Properties</code>..." support the
currently-<wbr>preferred <tt>.properties</tt> file-<wbr> based controller
configuration format.  These classes may also be deprecated some day, perhaps
in favor of a database-<wbr>driven configuration source.</p>
